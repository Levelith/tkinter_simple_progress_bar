This repository contains a Python script that uses the `tkinter` library to create a simple graphical user interface (GUI) simulating a file download process. The application includes a progress bar, dynamic percentage updates, and real-time status messages to visually represent the progress of the download.

## Features

- **Progress Bar**: A horizontal progress bar (`ttk.Progressbar`) dynamically updates to reflect the download progress.
- **Dynamic Text Updates**:
  - Displays the current percentage (e.g., "20%").
  - Shows the download status (e.g., "2/10 GB complete").
- **Start Button**: A "Download" button initiates the simulation, demonstrating how to trigger functionality in a GUI.
- **Recursive Updates**: The progress is updated using recursion and `window.after()`, simulating a real-time download process with adjustable speed and size.

---

## How It Works

1. Click the "Download" button to start the simulation.
2. The progress bar increments based on predefined download size (`GB`) and speed (`speed`).
3. Labels update dynamically to show:
   - The percentage completed (e.g., "20%").
   - The current download status (e.g., "2/10 GB complete").
4. The simulation runs until the progress reaches 100%.

## Installations

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://www.github.com/Levelith/simple-progressbar-py
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd simple-progressbar-py

---

## Usage

1. Run the script using Python:
    ```bash
    python main.py

- Click the "download" button to start the simulation.
- Observe the progress bar and labels updating in real time.

## Customization

Feel free to use this code for your Tkinter project and modify it as you wish. I'll show you a simple way to modify the simulator.

- `GB`: Total download size (in GB). Default is `10`.
    ```python
    GB = 10 # Change to your desired total size.

- `speed`: Download speed (in GB per second). Default is `1`.
